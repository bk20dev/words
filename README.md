# Words

A simple Android app for displaying a list of words

## Background

A few days ago, I started learning Android app development. While most of the topics were easy to understand, the
"Fragments and Navigation Component" was quite difficult. Therefore, I decided to create a simple application from
scratch.

## How it works

The app displays a list of letters on the main page. Then, you can choose one to see a list of words starting
with the picked letter. To search the internet for a definition, simply tap on any vocable.

## Running the app

To build the app, make sure you have **Android Studio** installed.

1. Get the code - either clone this repository or download and unpack a .zip
2. Open the project in android studio **File>Open**
3. Build and run the application by clicking on the **Run** button
